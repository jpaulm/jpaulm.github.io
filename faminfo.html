<h2>Family Information</h2>

<p>Owing to the circumstances of his mother and father's divorce, Paul knew very little about his Ashkenazi Jewish half, although he was told that his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyloric_stenosis">pyloric stenosis</a> (at about the age of 5-6 weeks, and successfully operated on) was a Jewish inheritance.&nbsp; Much later in life, after having been brought up only knowing a few Anglophile American (step-)relatives (he never met any of his mother's relatives), he found out about the extensive Rodker clan - at one point the Rodker family tree showed 56 2nd cousins!  Paul's other half is Scottish, Anglo-Irish, and a small amount of Scandinavian!</p>

Merci, Daniel! </p>	
<p>Paul's paternal grandfather, David, together with much of his family, joined the mass exodus of Jews from what is now Poland, most likely to escape the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom">pogroms</a> of the 1880s, moving to England, where the family worked hard and prospered, a number of them as corset-makers. An article in the Journal of the Utah Jewish Genealogical Society, <a href="http://www.ujgs.org/atsmi/UJGS_AtsmiUvsari_24.pdf">Atsmi uVsari</a>, Issue #24, Dec., 2010, describes the family's early days in England.&nbsp; As far as we know, all the Rodkers in the world are related - the name seems to have been invented for (or by) just this one family! There are now Rodker descendants spread from Vancouver, Canada, to Tasmania - it might be called the "Rodker diaspora"! </p>
					<p>The origin of the name Rodker has always been a bit of a mystery, but Paul recently guessed that Rodker might be a name derived from a place, like a number of more common Jewish names such as Berliner, Krakower, etc. Following that model, Paul posited there might be a town named Rodka somewhere in central Europe, and in fact there was a town with that name in what is now Romania, and its official name is now R&#259;d&#259;u&#539;i. Interestingly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=R%C4%83d%C4%83u%C8%9Bi&oldid=585532013">Wikipedia</a> says </p>
					<p><blockquote>"A Jewish community was present before the Habsburg takeover, and is attested to have been overseen by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starost">starost</a>. Many Jews fleeing the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (as well as other Habsburg areas) from intense persecution and anti-Semitism during the Middle Ages settled in R&#259;d&#259;u&#355;i. The community was allowed a degree of self-administration, and witnessed a period of prosperity and cultural effervescence during the 19th century." </blockquote></p>
					<p>This has now been corroborated by Oliver Rodker, Paul's late half-sister <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rodker">Joan</a>'s grandson, who says Joan told him this several years ago.&nbsp; This fact adds a fascinating footnote to the family's history. </p>
					<p>There is an interesting article about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rodker">John Rodker</a> on Wikipedia, mentioning, among other things, that he was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">conscientious objector</a> during World War I. He went on the run but was arrested and imprisoned in April 1917. John died in 1955, while Paul was still at university; John was fluent in French, writing regularly for a French literary magazine, and was awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9gion_d%27Honneur" title="Légion d'Honneur" class="mw-redirect">Légion d'Honneur</a> posthumously by the government of France for his services to French literature.</p>
					
					<p>Paul's mother, Barbara McKenzie-Smith,  was a painter, mostly doing paintings on commission, and a number of her paintings are hanging in various country houses around England, and also in the US. &nbsp; A family tree which includes Paul's mother and many of <em>her</em> ancestors is being maintained by one of Paul's second cousins, Howard Smith, based in Australia. It now goes back 9 generations on Paul's mother's side (to one Thomas Stanger, ca. 1610), and can be accessed starting at <a href="http://www.airgale.com.au/stanger-t/d10.htm#i12649"> Barbara Stanger McKenzie-Smith</a>.</p>

<p>Paul's mother was of Highland Scots and Irish ancestry (Stanger Smith). She always claimed a connection with  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulf_the_Earl">Ulf</a>, brother-in-law of King Canute, as her paternal grandmother was an Ulph, which is a Latinized form of the same name (via Ulphus). The Howard Smith referred to above has the middle name Ulph.  She was told that the famous <a href="http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/archeo/Angleterre/bone/horn.htm">Horn of Ulph</a> was connected with this family, although Ulf is a very popular Norse given name, and the Horn now is thought to be connected with a different Ulph.  <a href="https://www.myheritage.com">DNA analysis</a> has now corroborated the Scandinavian connection.</p>
                    
					<p>She was trained at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perse_School_for_Girls">Perse School</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slade_School">Slade School of Art</a>, and as a young person was involved in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group">Bloomsbury Group</a>. One of her closest friends was the lithographer, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trekkie_Parsons">Trekkie Parsons</a>, who became the longtime lover of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Woolf">Leonard Woolf</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>'s husband, after Virginia's death. Paul remembers being taken to see Leonard at his house in the country. He was also told that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moura_Budberg">Moura, Baroness Budberg</a>, was asked to be his godmother, as she was a friend of the Rodkers, but Paul has no recollection of actually meeting her, although his half-sister, Joan Rodker, who was sort of the family archivist, knew her well. </p>
					<p>Sadly, both of John's daughters have now passed on: Camilla Bagg died on December 1, 2007. She was the second-born of John Rodker's three children, but the first to pass on. Together with Nathalie Blondel, she edited a book about her mother, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Butts">Mary Butts</a>. John Rodker's first daughter, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Rodker">Joan Rodker</a>, passed away peacefully on Dec. 27, 2010, at the age of 95 after a brief illness. </p>
<p>Paul's son is the CEO at Concourse Global Enrollment, affiliated with <a href="http://www.grokglobal.com/">Grok Global Services</a> currently based in Beijing, and Paul's daughter, son-in-law and grandson live in Ontario, about an hour from Toronto.  </p>
